# First Repository
Lets see where this goes...

My name is @jtketz
I am currently interested in growing my programming skills and building on my engineering background.
I am currently tracking this progress in my repository jtketz/learningtocode
  - right now I am focusing on the 100days of code challenge and following some highly recommended resources like CS50!
I would be excited to learn with other beginners and collaborate wherever possible!

My professional interestes currently are focused in:
- biomedical engineering
- neuroscience
- biotechnology
- and all things merging tech and healthcare!
